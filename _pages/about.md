Junyan is currently a Ph.D. candidate at School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong in [Prof. Minghua Chen's group](https://www.mhchen.com). He received his bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University in 2019 mentored by [Prof. Boris Houska](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/). He recieved ACM e-Energy Best Paper Award in 2023. 
His research interests include intelligent transportation systems, from the perspective of control and optimization. He also has broad interests in computing methods for energy systems.
He is also the main developer of the [E2Pilot](https://www.e2pilots.com/) software.

<!-- I am following and working on the project: "Energy-Efficient Timely Transportation of Long-Haul Heavy-Duty Truck". Detailed descriptions and previous works can be found [here](https://www.mhchen.com/projects/trucking.html). 
From 2018 to 2019, I spent my senior year as a visiting student in the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley.

### On-going project
- <a href="{{ '/projects/cfo' | relative_url }}">Follow the Sun and Go with the Wind: Carbon Footprint Optimized Timely E-Truck Transportation</a>
    - <span style="color:red">Best paper award</span> at ACM e-Energy 2023
    - We study an important yet challenging problem , namely the carbon footprint optimization problem for e-trucks.
    - We provide a novel problem formulation , which incurs low model complexity and reveals a useful problem structure.
