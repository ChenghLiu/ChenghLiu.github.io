This is Junyan Su (苏隽岩). I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University in 2019. During my stay at ShanghaiTech, I joined [Prof. Boris Houska's group](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/). 
From 2018 to 2019, I spent my senior year as a visiting student in the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong in [Prof. Minghua Chen's group](http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/mchen88/index.html). 
My research interests include intelligent transportation, and online optimization. I am following and working on the project: "Energy-Efficient Timely Transportation of Long-Haul Heavy-Duty Truck". Detailed descriptions and previous works can be found [here](http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/mchen88/projects/trucking.html).
