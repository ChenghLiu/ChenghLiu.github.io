This blog serves a writing style guide for myself. I summarize them here for future reference. I will gradually add more tips to this blog. Hopefully it will converge to a stable version that helps me to write good academic papers.

### 1. Tips

- **Cite a website:** There is no standard. The safest way is put everything into reference list and use in-text cite. If you must put a website in a footnote. Only use it when citing an entire website. See [this website](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-examples/website/) and [this website](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/8098/how-should-i-cite-a-website-url) for a discussion. 
- **Footnote** only used for additional information or copyright permission. See [this website](https://writingcommons.org/article/using-footnotes-apa/).
- Put comma after "i.e." and "e.g."


### 2. Notation conventions

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujunyan/tex-gallery/main/submodules/notation/notation.png">
    </div>
</div>
