  abstract={
    Electrifying heavy-duty trucks is crucial for decarbonizing transportation, but maximizing their potential requires minimizing the carbon footprint of timely deliveries. This complex optimization task involves strategic path, speed, and charging planning, which traditional methods struggle to optimize at scale. We present a novel stage-expanded graph formulation that reduces complexity and reveals a useful problem structure. Our formulation naturally decomposes the problem into more tractable subproblems, allowing efficient coordination between routing and charging decisions, and maintains a manageable graph size. We exploit these structural insights to design an efficient algorithm with strong performance guarantees. Simulations using real-world data over the U.S. highway system demonstrate that our method complements the 44\% carbon reduction from electrification with an additional 24\% decrease, totaling a 68\% reduction. Moreover, our carbon-optimized strategy, applicable to various truck types, can achieve comparable carbon reductions 16 years sooner than zero-emission truck adoption alone. 
    This approach significantly accelerates transportation decarbonization, offering a powerful tool in the fight against climate change.

  abstract={
    We consider the scenario where an energy harvesting source sends its updates to a receiver. The source optimizes its energy allocation over a decision period to maximize a sum of time-varying functions of the age of information (AoI), representing the value of providing timely information. In a practical online setting, we need to make irrevocable energy allocation decisions at each time while the time-varying functions and the energy arrivals are only revealed sequentially.  The problem is then challenging as 1) we are facing uncertain energy harvesting arrivals and time-varying functions, and 2) the energy allocation decisions and the energy harvesting process are coupled due to the capacity-limited battery. In this paper, we develop an optimal online algorithm \textsf{CR-RePursuit} and show it achieves $(\ln\theta+1)$-competitiveness, where $\theta$ is a parameter representing the level of uncertainty of the time-varying functions. It is the optimal competitive ratio among all deterministic and randomized online algorithms. We also introduce an adaptive variant of the algorithm, {\textsf{CR-RePursuit+}}, that further exploits the revealed information to obtain significantly improved empirical performance. We conduct simulations based on real-world traces and compare our algorithms with conceivable alternatives. The results show that our algorithms achieve 15\% performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.
